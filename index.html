		For starters, my name is Kevin Chiang. I grew in the suburbs of Philadelphia and am a die-hard Eagles fan. I went to West Chester University where I graduated with a BFA in Graphic Design. I grew up thinking that I would work in the health and medical field but I think that deep down inside I was always going to end up as a Graphic Designer. Constantly doodling in class, excelling in my art courses, and in high school even took an introductory course in graphic design. Ever since it has been a passion of mine. I nerd out over beautiful fonts, stress about type placement, and never stop searching for inspiration.</p>

		<p>In my free time I am an avid Ultimate Frisbee player and was even once considered a professional in the sport. I had the esteem privilege to be a part of the AUDL (American Ultimate Disc League) in it’s inaugural season. Playing for the first ever professional champions, the Philadelphia Spinners,  I learned a lot about myself that season. I learned that I can always dig a little deeper and push myself further than I originally thought. If competition wasn’t enough motivation for me, having an ex-marine for a coach certainly pushed it over the top!</p>

		<p>Other than Ultimate Frisbee I am a music fanatic. I, myself, am not the most talented musician (my high school teacher, Mr. Cooper can attest to that) but I find myself drawn and inspired by fresh emerging artists. There’s something very inspirational about musicians that can put their own flavor into their music.</p>

		<p>I am a motivated and dedicated designer, and have aspirations of becoming an art director for a major corporation. I think that being able to influence how a business/personal brand is viewed by the general public is an amazing gift. Please let me know how I can help you and/or your company!</p>
